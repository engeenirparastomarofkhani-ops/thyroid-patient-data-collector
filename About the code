# Detailed Project Information
## Objective: Classification and Analysis of Thyroid Disease
In this project, I wrote a program that takes three attributes from the user. Name, age, and thyroid disease status.
These three are done by a for loop. At the end of the loop, I embedded a dictionary so that when the information is given, it is stored in the dictionary.
Since the append() method cannot be used for dictionaries, we store this dictionary in a list that we have defined outside the loop, using this method.
Now, to classify (analyze) the data, we create three lists named normal, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid. Now, to check the value of the keyword thyroid status, 
I write a loop with the variable p, which is equal to a line of dictionary information each time in the loop:
p = {"name":"Ali","age":30,"ST":"normal"}

Then in this loop, in the next step, I wrote a condition so that I can check which list the keyword is equal to:

if p["ST"] == "normal":

If it is equal, it is added to the list. If it is not equal, the rest of the condition is checked and placed in the other lists.

In the next section, using the len() method, I printed the values ​​in the lists to the output. In the next section, using the print() function and a for loop,
I printed only the two keywords from the dictionary to the output.
