# Thyroid Patient Data Collector (Python)

## Description
This project is a simple Python-based program designed to collect and analyze thyroid patient data.
It is part of my learning journey toward applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in healthcare.

The program collects basic patient information, stores it using Python data structures, and performs a basic analysis of thyroid status distribution.

## Features
Collects patient information (name, age, thyroid status)

Stores data using Python dictionaries and lists

Counts the number of patients in each thyroid category (normal, hypo, hyper)

Displays patient summaries

## Technologies
Python
Core data structures (lists, dictionaries)
Conditional statements and loops

##  Purpose
This project serves as an initial step toward building medical data-driven applications and preparing for more advanced machine learning projects in healthcare.

## Future Work
Data preprocessing and label encoding
Applying machine learning models for thyroid disease classification
Working with real-world medical datasets
Expanding the project using pandas and NumPy

## About Me
Biomedical Engineering graduate with a strong interest in AI for healthcare.
Currently building Python and medical data projects as preparation for graduate studies and research.
